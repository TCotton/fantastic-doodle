        "mainContent": "<p>HRH The Princess Royal has officially opened the iPort Rail strategic rail freight terminal in Doncaster.</p>\n<p>Her Royal Highness was met by local dignitaries and escorted around the site by Verdion CEO Michael Hughes, who presented members of the iPort Rail team, wider iPort development team, funder HOOPP (Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan), businesses based at iPort and representatives of the iPort Academy.</p>\n<p>iPort Rail is a state-of-the-art multimodal rail terminal, which is designed to open up the Yorkshire region with new road, rail and air connections for national and international freight transport.</p>\n<p>Located on a 30-acre site within the 337-acre iPort logistics hub, iPort Rail is able to accommodate the UK’s longest trains up to six times a day. It has storage capacity for 1,500 TEUs and is operated by reach stackers which can each lift a 115-tonne load.</p>\n<p>iPort connects to the electrified East Coast Main Line and is located next to the M18, close to Doncaster Sheffield Airport and within two hours of the East Coast’s deep-water ports.<br />\nHer Royal Highness The Princess Royal, upon unveiling the plaque to mark the opening of the facility, said: “This is a huge project, not just for Doncaster but for the wider region. It already sets the standard for logistics development and there is more to come. Congratulations on what you have achieved so far.”</p>\n<p>Michael Hughes, CEO of Verdion, which developed iPort and is running iPort Rail as an independent operation, said: “This day has been 15 years in the making and is a proud moment for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>“Putting a rail freight hub at the heart of the site is part of the reason this is the UK’s most advanced multimodal logistics hub.</p>\n<p>“This is the perfect location. 87% of the UK’s population is within a four-hour drive time and there are excellent connections to and from the site by road, rail and air, while the East Coast deep water port are only two hours away.</p>\n<p>“We have worked very closely with Doncaster Council, the Sheffield-Doncaster Region and many other local stakeholders every step of the way – as well as with our funding partner HOOPP. We could not have asked for more creative and positive working relationships – strong private and public sector cooperation has been essential.”</p>\n<p>iPort itself will bring up to 5,000 new jobs to the area. Over 2 million sq ft (184,800 sq m) has already been committed to Fellowes, CEVA, Lidl and Amazon and Verdion has created a large area enhancement to landscape and ecology habitats in partnership with the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.</p>\n<p>Steve Freeman, Managing Director for iPort Rail, said: “The connectivity and quality of our facility at iPort Rail is genuinely unique, and businesses taking space here can take advantage of the major benefits that better access to rail freight offers. Occupiers at iPort are already to use the rail freight facility on-site, but we are also open to businesses across the country, even if they’re not already based here.</p>\n<p>“Following the official opening, from next week we will be running up to six trains a day, six days a week with a 24 operation during those times We are already seeing very promising demand from the industry, particularly because of the benefits rail freight can provide when the road haulage industry is increasingly stretched.”</p>\n<p>Cllr Bill Mordue, Cabinet Member for Business, Skills and Economic Development at Doncaster Council, said: “The growth at iPort has been astonishing. The site has already welcomed globally recognised tenants and the opening of its rail freight facility is another big step forward for Verdion’s ambitious plans. It was our forward-thinking vision to create Great Yorkshire Way which has seen iPort develop at such a rapid rate boosting our growing economy. iPort is a huge success story for Doncaster and the wider region.”</p>\n",

        "mainContent": "<p>Verdion and the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) have secured the former RAF Brüggen site on the German-Dutch border for the creation of a 177-hectare logistics park. It was acquired from local development company “Energie- und Gewerbepark Elmpt” mbH (EGE). Over €500 million will now be invested in the project to create a strategic regional logistics hub.</p>\n<p>The site – to be known as Javelin Park – is the latest in Verdion’s strategic site development programme, which sits alongside the firm’s investment management and specialist industrial and logistics development activity. It has already established the €580+ million (£500+ million) iPort logistics hub and rail freight terminal in Doncaster, UK, with HOOPP; and recently launched the €200 million E20 Park Copenhagen on Denmark’s main Germany-Sweden road corridor.</p>\n<p>Javelin Park will be located directly on Germany’s A52 motorway, which connects the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region with Roermond in the Netherlands. The deep-water ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam can both be reached in two hours.</p>\n<p>Around 567,000 sq m of logistics, business and light industrial space is planned over a 10–15-year period, with sustainability and energy efficiency central to the emerging concept designs and all new buildings targeting the DGNB Gold certification.</p>\n<p>Preserving the site’s history is also a priority. Located in Niederkrüchten-Elmpt, RAF Brüggen served for many years as an important British air base in Germany, with several units stationed there between 1953 and 2001. In 2002 it was transferred to the British Army and renamed Javelin Barracks. It was finally vacated in December 2015 as the last remaining British forces withdrew from Germany, and has been out of use ever since.</p>\n<p>Michael Hughes, CEO of Verdion, said: “This is a major strategic opportunity, and the €500 million investment planned represents our biggest single investment in Germany to date. As part of Verdion’s pan-European programme for large scale park developments, Javelin Park will become one of the best business environments of its kind in Germany, one that will generate considerable opportunity and growth prospects both locally and regionally.</p>\n<p>“Our objective is a high-quality, flexible and sustainable design concept that meets the needs of all potential occupiers, both large and small. We’re looking forward to working with the local community to bring the site through the zoning process and back into economic use, and will do so in a way that respects its rich history.”</p>\n<p>Dr Andreas Coenen, District Administrator and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of EGE, commented: “One of the most important economic projects in the region is out of the starting blocks today. The business park will contribute positively to the economic and social development of the county over the coming decades.” Karl-Heinz Wassong, Mayor of Niederkrüchten, added: “The business park is a double opportunity: It attracts new companies to Niederkrüchten and offers those in the region new growth potential.”</p>\n<p>Javelin Park is being funded by Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP), one of Canada’s largest pension funds and one of Verdion’s longstanding funding partners. Over the past seven years the partnership has created a specialist logistics portfolio valued at over €1.2 billion.</p>\n",

The strategic investment will enable Boeing to build out its capacity and product portfolio, further strengthening its value proposition and growth strategy in the highly competitive aerospace market. With the construction work starting in March, the facility is expected to be operational by Q2 2022.</p>\n<p>The 34,347 m² site is situated within a short driving distance from Hamburg and Hamburg Airport, offering an ideal location to supply a variety of global customers. The 19,254 m² building will include a 15,352 m² warehouse space with areas especially designed for Boeing’s needs as well as 153 parking spaces. 3,251 m² of office space will be connected to the warehouse facility. For the development, the project partners are targeting the Gold-level certification issued by the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) in line with their commitment to minimise the environmental impact.</p>\n<p>“This new facility underlines our continued commitment to further strengthen and support the German aviation sector and consolidates our leading position in the European distribution services market. While the aerospace industry is facing challenging times, we want to build on our presence in Germany to ensure long-term growth,” said Dr. Michael Haidinger, President, Boeing Deutschland.</p>\n<p>John Clements, Executive Director of Verdion, commented: “This facility combines state-of-the-art storage, distribution and offices, setting the standard for Boeing’s regional distribution centre and making clear its commitment to the sector. It successfully addresses the twin challenges of secure storage for sensitive goods and ready access to the company’s locations across northern Germany from a growing logistics hotspot that offers an alternative to Hamburg’s undersupplied market.”</p>\n<p>Warburg-HIH Invest financed the project and will lease the building to Boeing. “With the purchase of the property, we achieve an even broader geographical and tenant diversification of our portfolio,” said Hans-Joachim Lehmann, Managing Director of Warburg-HIH Invest. “In addition, we are further expanding the fund’s core orientation with the property, which is leased for the long term.”</p>\n<p>“We are very happy that Boeing chose Henstedt-Ulzburg as its location,” said Mayor Ulrike Schmidt. “The company is already present in the region so that important skilled labour will be retained. The 15-year location guarantee underline Boeing’s plans to stay in Henstedt-Ulzburg for the long term and expand its presence here.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Bernd Bösche, Managing Director of the Business Development and Technology Transfer Corporation of Schleswig-Holstein (WTSH), concluded: “Boeing’s decision to select Henstedt-Ulzburg as its location is proof of Schleswig-Holstein’s site advantages for international companies. In addition to a good transport infrastructure and the proximity to Hamburg Airport, the availability of qualified specialists is a particularly important location factor. We are pleased that we were able to support Boeing in finding the perfect business venue in Henstedt-Ulzburg. A warm welcome and good luck.”</p>\n",

        "mainContent": "<p class=\"p1\">Verdion is significantly strengthening its commitment to the Nordics, with two senior appointments charged with increasing the business’s investment and development activity across the region. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Since 2013 Verdion has created a €1.5 billion European logistics portfolio comprising new build and value-add redevelopment projects across Germany, the UK, the Nordics, Benelux and the Czech Republic. Highlights in the Nordics include specialist facilities for BMW and a pharmaceutical client of DHL as well as E20 Park Copenhagen, a €200m new logistics park development, which sits on the main Germany-Sweden artery south of the city.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In addition to increasing this development pipeline, Verdion will be deploying substantial capital in support of its €300 million Verdion European Logistics Fund 1. VELF 1 held <span class=\"s1\">its final close in September 2020 and is focussed on core plus and value add urban logistics assets in edge-of-town or infill locations to fulfil last-mile requirements.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Head of Investment – Nordics: </b>Peter Michael Tetzlaff has joined Verdion as Head of Investment – Nordics, following several years with CBRE’s Capital Markets Team in Copenhagen. Focussed on overseeing and growing Verdion’s investment management business across the region, his role will include identifying and acquiring investment opportunities and overseeing the execution of associated leasing and development activities for both VELF 1 and the wider Verdion business. He will join Verdion’s Investment Committee, alongside CEO Michael Hughes, CFO Paul Clarke, Director – Asset Management Simon Walter, and Florian Stöbe, Head of Investment – Germany. Peter is based at Verdion’s new offices in Copenhagen.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Head of Business Development – Nordics: </b>Johan Nihlmark today joins Verdion as<b> </b>Head of Business Development – Nordics after an eight-year career with Prologis in Gothenburg. He will lead on all Verdion’s leasing activities in the region, including build to suit and speculative development projects, and is focussed on developing the business’s pipeline – drawing on his strong network of brokers and occupiers to source and deliver new opportunities, primarily in Sweden and Denmark. He will be based at Verdion’s new offices in Gothenburg.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Michael Hughes, CEO of Verdion, said: “The Nordics presents significant opportunities for growth, with a marked disparity between consumers’ expectations and the standard and volume of logistics stock currently available – especially in the ecommerce arena. Strong occupier demand for more space is complemented by institutional investor appetite for high quality logistics assets for long-term management.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We will be targeting a wide range of opportunities as a result – from strategic sites for longer term park development to core plus and value-add assets that can be repurposed quickly to meet market demand.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Not only will these appointments provide an active presence in our primary targets of Denmark and Sweden, but Peter and Johan’s experience will be an enormous benefit to our business as a whole, linking into our teams in the UK and Germany to provide a broader perspective on the sector as it continues to accelerate.”</p>\n",

        "mainContent": "<p>One of the UK’s largest, privately-owned logistics companies Woodland Group, has taken a 195,000 sq ft warehouse at iPort, Verdion’s multimodal logistics hub in Doncaster.</p>\n<p>The new fulfilment and distribution facility will be the latest addition to Woodland Group’s existing footprint across five locations in Yorkshire and enables its growth of employment in the Yorkshire region by 35%. It is part of a strategic move to service the growing needs of existing and recently won new business in the packaging industry, will offer Woodland’s carbon-conscious supply chain solutions and deliver access across the UK and direct services into Europe.</p>\n<p>iPort is the UK’s most advanced multimodal facility, spanning 800 acres with 52 MVA power, close to junction 3 of the M18 in Doncaster. Already home to CEVA Fellowes, Lidl, Kingsbury Press and Amazon, its on-site rail freight terminal takes daily services to/from Southampton, Felixstowe and Teesport with more routes across the UK being planned.</p>\n<p>Alongside its programme of speculatively-developed space at iPort, Verdion’s masterplan also includes development-ready sites for units of up to 800,000 sq ft that can be built to suit specific occupier requirements.</p>\n<p>John Clements, Executive Director at Verdion, said: “The combination of high-quality warehousing and on-site rail services is increasingly attractive to businesses like Woodland Group, who are successfully building their businesses while focussing on environmentally-conscious supply chains. Demand for well-connected, well-resourced logistics space continues to grow and the ability to make road and rail connections across the country and into Europe from this central hub is increasingly attractive.”</p>\n<p>Kevin Stevens, CEO of Woodland Group, commented: “Our new Doncaster site represents our great commitment to Yorkshire and the surrounding area and our continued investment into environmental supply chain solutions to aid our clients in cutting cost and carbon footprint. Its fantastic location makes it an ideal international hub plugging into our global supply chain offering as well as a solid addition to our full domestic operations through our own sites and equipment across the UK. Our Doncaster facility boasts state-of-the-art technology and our full digital offering alongside its conscious and innovative solutions to domestic and international fulfilment and distribution, thus offering both UK and overseas clients full access to the vast opportunities emerging in the UK and surrounding markets post Brexit.”</p>\n",

        "mainContent": "<p>Equity Estate Group has sold a strategic logistics park on the outskirts of the German town of Kassel to Verdion European Logistics Fund 1 (VELF1) for EUR 28 million. The park is situated in the Lohfelden logistics hotspot just outside Kassel, strategically located on the  A7 highway in Central Germany – the country’s longest autobahn and an important north-south route.</p>\n<p>The property was held by Equity Estate Group for almost 15 years, forming part of the Queristics portfolio which was raised in 2005. In 2018 Equity Estate recapitalised the portfolio. In 2019 a property in the Netherlands was sold, followed by the second divestment of a logistics building in Willebroek, Belgium in 2020. With the sale of the Lohfelden property the recapitalisation of 2018 will be fully repaid.</p>\n<p>This transaction is the fifth and largest acquisition so far for Verdion European Logistics Fund 1 (VELF1) SCSp, which held its final close in September 2020 and is focussed on urban logistics assets in edge-of-town or infill locations that facilitate swift product delivery to major cities/towns, meeting the last-mile requirements. It is targeting value-add/core-plus investments in Germany, the Nordics, Benelux and other select markets across Europe.</p>\n<p>The 58,307 sqm plot currently comprises 16,046 sqm of warehousing and 3,852 sqm office/ commercial spaces in three buildings. Two are leased for a commercial vehicle parts centre, agricultural dealership and central warehouse. The other tenant specializes in thermoplastic extrusion. The acquisition also includes additional land with potential for a new warehouse of around  6,000 sqm plus 500 sqm office space and a 1,228 sqm mezzanine creating a total lettable area of 7,920 sqm in line with current zoning plans.</p>\n<p>Florian Stöbe, Verdion Head of Investment – Germany said: “This asset is exactly in line with our value-add/core+ strategy: a site with great potential in one of the country’s most important logistics hotspots, combined with long term commitments from existing tenants. The intention now is to commence speculative development to meet continuing demand for high quality space from ecommerce occupiers in particular– an approach the fund is adopting across other invested locations.”</p>\n<p>CBRE and Baker McKenzie advised Equity Estate Group in this transaction. Verdion was advised by REC Partners and GSK Stockmann.</p>\n",

Once established, the freeport would help build on South Yorkshire’s longstanding reputation for innovation and excellence, and further establish the region as a hub for global trade and investment.</p>\n<p>The Freeport, backed by key industry figures and politicians, centres around Doncaster Sheffield Airport and Verdion’s iPort logistics hub – which have substantial plans for growth – major manufacturers including Sheffield Forgemasters and Liberty Steel, and more than 360 hectares of land primed for development (at GatewayEast, Junction36 and iPort).</p>\n<p>New modelling suggests a Freeport in the South Yorkshire would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create 28,700 new jobs</li>\n<li>Increase wages by at least east 19% (due to a focus on advanced manufacturing)</li>\n<li>Add £169m to the South Yorkshire economy every year</li>\n<li>Boost imports by £306m and exports by £410m</li>\n<li>Unlock or accelerate over £500m of investment</li>\n<li>Transform the Sheffield City Region into a net exporter of goods by 2029</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Michael Hughes, CEO of Verdion – which is responsible for Doncaster’s iPort logistics hub – commented: “A inland freeport in South Yorkshire would be a huge boost – for trade, development, investment and jobs. Its location at the heart of the country with so much critical infrastructure and space for future growth already in place offers enormous potential.”</p>\n<p>Robert Hough, Chair of Peel Airports Group which includes Doncaster Sheffield Airport said: “Ports and airports are well known as hubs for global trade and investment., Freeport status would only enhance that. By bringing together the UK’s first strategic rail port for a decade at iPort and one of the longest runways in the UK with capacity to grow at Doncaster Sheffield Airport. Peel, Harworth and Verdion have proven track records in delivering transformational projects, helping to create jobs and opportunities for local people.”</p>\n<p>Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis said: “Establishing a freeport will help our region’s businesses and universities export ideas, goods and services across the world, supporting our ambitions for a new era of prosperity and a stronger, greener and fairer economy for South Yorkshire after the coronavirus pandemic. It will help to unlock our region’s potential and create opportunities for people, places and businesses.</p>\n<p>“Our region has incredible strengths in research and innovation and businesses capable of substantial growth. Government must now back our bid to establish a freeport to generate the jobs, training and investment needed to deliver prosperity for people and businesses across the region and the North.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity for government to show its commitment to levelling up and unlock South Yorkshire’s potential.”</p>\n<p><strong><u>South Yorkshire Freeport’s backers</u></strong></p>\n<p>Sheffield Forgemasters</p>\n<p>Liberty Steel</p>\n<p>McLaren Automotive</p>\n<p>Hird Group</p>\n<p>Peel L&amp;P</p>\n<p>Doncaster Sheffield Airport</p>\n<p>iPort</p>\n<p>Verdion</p>\n<p>Hird Group</p>\n<p>Advanced Manufacturing Park</p>\n<p>Sheffield, Doncaster, Barnsley &amp; Rotherham Chambers of Commerce</p>\n<p>Harworth Group</p>\n<p>Sheffield City Region Mayoral Combined Authority</p>\n<p>Sheffield City Region LEP</p>\n<p>Doncaster and Barnsley Councils</p>\n<p>South Yorkshire International Trade Forum</p>\n",

        "mainContent": "<p>The project partnership between pan-European logistics specialist Verdion and German LIST Group has handed over a new warehouse facility in Hof, south-eastern Germany, to international freight company Dachser SE.</p>\n<p>The 42,600 sq.m. plot on Hermann-und-Bertl-Müller-Strasse accommodates 21,600 sq.m. of logistics space as well as a three-storey building providing 900 sq.m. of office space.</p>\n<p>LIST Bau Nordhorn started construction in January this year and the team delivered the project on schedule in October 2020. In April, the asset was sold for €18.5 million in a forward deal to Hamburg-based investment manager HANSAINVEST Real Assets. It now becomes part of the HANSA Europe Logistics Fund.</p>\n<p>From Hof, Dachser services SME companies working in construction, grocery and industry as well as garden centres. The new building, which offers space for 39,000 pallets, is located next to an existing 25,000 sq.m. Dachser logistics centre. With this second lease, the company has expanded its local presence and now employs 500 people in Hof. Another 300, including seasonal workers or independent carriers, regularly work for Dachser on site.</p>\n<p>“With this built-to-suit project, we have further strengthened our successful partnership with international logistics company Dachser,” says André Banschus, Executive Director of Verdion. “Sustainability was a particularly important focus in our design approach, with important details incorporated throughout the building, including an impressive roof structure completely made of wood,” he added. Verdion has leased two new warehouses to Dachser at Verdion Airpark Berlin in addition to this project.</p>\n<p>Klaus Nebing, General Manager of the Dachser logistics centre in Hof, comments: “Even in challenging times such as during the current Corona pandemic, Dachser in Hof is a reliable partner for its clients and partners. We are looking forward to implementing a sustainable, growth-oriented logistics concept on site. That is how we are keeping our clients’ global commodity flow running.”</p>\n",

Two thirds of the speculatively built space in this final phase of the logistics park near the German are now leased.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Walter Schulze GmbH took out a ten-year lease on a 5,778 sq m logistics property. The company will be processing its online wholesale business with printable merchandising such as t-shirts, mugs or sheeting on site. In a second property with 5,329 sq m of space, HOCO Online GmbH will be handling its online delivery business for bicycles and spare parts, also on a ten-year lease. Two further properties with around 5,000 sq m each are still available.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With Walter Schulze and HOCO Online, we attracted two Berlin SMEs with growing space needs for their online businesses to the Verdion Airpark Berlin,” says Stephan Dalbeck, Business Development and Portfolio Director at Verdion. “The remaining space is also ideal for SMEs or start-ups whose distribution activities have grown beyond the capacities of the office post room or the garage. Pharma or fresh food logistics companies, which are seeking a quick route into Berlin’s inner city, will also profit from the location. There is currently no other logistics development closer to CBD.” Berlin’s central Mitte district can be reached within 30 minutes from Verdion Airpark Berlin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Verdion Airpark Berlin</strong></p>\n<p>Verdion Airpark Berlin offers excellent access to Berlin’s major motorways. The facility is located directly on the B96a, a major road connecting in just two kilometres to the inner and outer orbitals (A10 and A100). Berlin’s Schönefeld Airport and the new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport are both within a ten-kilometre radius and the site is easily accessible by public transport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A 10,000 sq m logistics property has already been completed as part of the third building phase of Verdion Airpark Berlin. It is leased to logistics company DACHSER SE. In total, the park has an area of 80,000 sq m, with other tenants including the food delivery service Bringmeister, metal industry company PUK, DÜRKOP GmbH, a spare parts supplier for branded garages, and Streiff &amp; Helmold, a rail transport service provider.</p>\n<p>The pan-European property investment manager PATRIZIA AG is financing Verdion Airpark Berlin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://verdionairpark.com/\">verdionairpark.com</a></p>\n",

The new building enables us to modernise production and increase efficiency and opens up further growth opportunities.” Xylem currently employs around 400 people at its existing location.</p>\n<p>“A tailor-made concept for the versatile new location of Xylem will be created at Achalaich in the next few months,” said André Banschus, Executive Director of Verdion. “It covers 15,000 sq m in four parts of the building: a production facility, a distribution centre, a research laboratory, and offices/common areas. When building the production plant in which measuring devices, sensors and accessories are manufactured, we draw on our many years of expertise in the field of delivering state of the art facilities for manufacturing and industrial clients with complex technical requirements.”</p>\n<p>The total volume of the project is over €20 million. It is funded by the Canadian Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP), which partners with Verdion to finance, develop and manage logistics projects across Europe. After completion at the end of 2020, the property will continue to be held for the institutional investor and will be managed by Verdion. Xylem has signed a 15-year lease.</p>\n<p>Xylem’s Analytics business unit manufactures physico-chemical analysis devices for applications in the areas of water, wastewater, marine and coastal waters, food, beverages, the environment, chemistry and pharmacy. It is moving from the existing location on Dr Karl-Slevogt-Strasse to the modern, needs-based facility.</p>\n<p>Weilheim is located about 50 km southwest of Munich, near the Ammersee and the Starnberger See. The Achalaich industrial area is connected to the B2, which, as Germany’s longest federal highway, connects Berlin via Munich with Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Weilheim is also on the Munich – Garmisch-Partenkirchen railway line.</p>\n",

Construction will start early next year with handover expected at the end of 2021.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Mecklenburger Ernte has taken the existing Unit 2 at the site – a total of 10,595 sq m – while the new third unit is being constructed. Mecklenburger Ernte’s 12-year lease will transfer across to the new building on handover. BNP acted as intermediary in this deal. Unit 1 is let to DB Schenker.</p>\n<p>Verdion acquired the asset in March 2019 as part of an ongoing £300 million investment programme for its discretionary fund, Verdion European Logistics Fund (VELF) 1. The fund is focussed on last mile and value-add logistics opportunities in Northern and Central Europe with potential for value creation through technical innovation, development and asset management activity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last month Verdion acquired a 24,000 sq m warehouse in Roosendaal on the Dutch-Belgian border for €17 million in an off-market deal for the same fund. Located in an established logistics area between Rotterdam and Antwerp the building includes 18,000 sq m let to specialist logistics company Imperial Group, together with further space for occupation and an adjacent land plot with permission for a further 10,000 sq m of new build warehouse space.</li>\n<li>In Germany, it acquired a 10,000 sq m logistics building the Lower Rhine region town of Nettetal also for VELF 1. Under a three-year sale and leaseback deal with French logistics firm Egetra, the property is ideally situated for last mile logistics occupiers with potential for an additional 6,000 sq m of new development.</li>\n<li>These deals follow on from Verdion’s first investment for the fund in the Czech Republic, with the completion of a €17 million forward funding of a major project for UPS in Prague, consolidating three of the company’s fulfilment centres to create a 13,600 sq m national HQ and logistics hub on land adjacent to the City Airport.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Florian Stöbe, Head of Investment Germany at Verdion, says: “Being able to provide existing space as well as launching a new strategic development on the same site showcases our skill of investing in locations that require experienced asset managers. With the transitional lease, we enabled Mecklenburger Ernte to operate and expand their business immediately from existing space while lining up a bespoke new building next door for longer-term occupation.</p>\n<p>“Strategic locations like this one are the focus of the new fund. We are increasingly registering a rise in demand both in the stationary grocery sector as well as in online delivery, which we intend to leverage in the coming months with further investments by VELF1.”</p>\n",

Value-add investment strategies require deep, sector specific expertise, combining high technical competence and strong commercial networks. Florian has an excellent track record and will be a great asset to the team.”</p>\n<p>As a result of these changes Verdion’s investment committee will be expanded to include the new Heads of Investment for each key territory, chaired by Verdion’s CEO.

        "mainContent": "<p>HANSAINVEST Real Assets GmbH has purchased a logistics building in Hof in northern Bavaria for HANSA Europe Logistic Fund. The built-to-suit property was sold by a joint venture between Verdion and the LIST Group.</p>\n<p>The real estate is currently under construction and scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2020. DACHSER SE, a German family-owned logistics company headquartered in Kempten (Allgäu), has been acquired as the tenant for the entire logistics building. Dachser plans to utilise the real estate as a multi-user logistics property, among other things also for a key account from the DIY / construction and garden centre industry. The purchase price amounts to a total of approx. 18.5 million euros.</p>\n<p>The property has a total leasable area of about 22,450 square metres, characterised above all by the logistics section with 20,800 square metres and a three-storey office and social area covering ca. 900 square metres. In addition there is an area of some 750 square metres in the warehouse complex for hazardous materials. The site in Hof in the Nuremberg metropolitan region is conveniently located for traffic close to the A9 autobahn halfway between Frankfurt and Prague as well as between Munich and Berlin. Local public transport is easily reached on foot, with the journey to the city centre and Hof central station taking less than 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“With this successful purchase our HANSA Europe Logistic Fund has already acquired the fifth logistics property and the first piece of real estate in Germany in a very short space of time. Dachser as a longterm tenant suits the site in an ideal manner and also our investment approach,” comments Philipp Middendorp, Head of Logistics Acquisitions HANSAINVEST Real Assets.</p>\n<p>“This modern, customised built-to-suit project, coupled with a strong tenant such as Dachser, provides true added value for every core portfolio,” says André Banschus, Executive Director of Verdion GmbH. “In addition there is a focus on sustainability. One example: the supporting structure for the roof is made entirely of wood, and thus from a renewable raw material, which also binds CO2. The project is running to schedule and will be completed in the fourth quarter.”</p>\n<p>The seller was advised on the transaction by KPMG Law; the buyer was advised by GSK Stockmann and REC Partners GmbH. The transaction was brokered by Colliers International.</p>\n",

Four new buildings are being brought forward speculatively, each offering 54,000 sq ft (5,000 sq m) of space. Completion is planned for the second quarter of 2020.</p>\n<p>Located 30 minutes from Central Berlin and close to Schönefeld Airport, each new building will be highly energy-efficient, as well as offering five loading bays, a floor load capacity of 50 kN/sq m, office space, and common areas. The space can be configured flexibly to suit tenants’ needs.</p>\n<p>Phase 1 of the park originally completed in 2016, with a total of 317,500 sq ft</p>\n<p>(29,500 sq m) occupied by food delivery service Bringmeister, metalworking company PUK, and international logistics group DACHSER SE. Phase 2 – 238,500 sq ft (22,150 sq m) – was completed in 2018, with half of the space leased to DÜRKOP GmbH, an auto repair parts supplier for many leading car brands, and the other half leased to Streiff &amp; Helmold, a railroad services provider. Most recently Verdion has leased a second building on the park, a 107,500-sq-ft (10,000-sq-m) logistics facility, to Dachser SE.</p>\n<p>“Urban logistics facilities are in demand as never before,” says Stephan Dalbeck, Business and Portfolio Director at Verdion. “Whether for online retailers promising same-day delivery, perishable products, or time-sensitive pharmaceuticals: when it comes to offering close-range access to the Berlin market, there is currently no other logistics development that is closer to the city centre.</p>\n<p>“The space is particularly suited to Berlin’s many smaller companies and rapidly growing start-ups. Because speed to market is increasingly essential for so many companies, we have undertaken this development project on a speculative basis. At the same time, the buildings have been designed to offer flexibility so that each one can be configured each individual occupier’s needs.”</p>\n<p>Construction is being managed by LIST Bau Nordhorn as general contractor. Other key partners in the project are tricer management GmbH as project manager and Architekturbüro Kühling as project architect.</p>\n",

The company is expanding its presence in Hof and will employ around 500 people here once the project is complete. In addition, around 300 people work regularly for Dachser at the site through independent transport companies or as seasonal workers.</p>\n<p>Verdion is developing the project with LIST Develop Commercial. Contractor LIST Bau Nordhorn is constructing the new logistics property on a turnkey basis.</p>\n<p>André Banschus, Executive Director of Verdion, said: “We are pleased to be working with Dachser once again and bringing forward this project with the LIST Group to the highest standards. In addition to storage space, the new property also offers space for packaging and thus ideally complements the existing Dachser portfolio.”</p>\n<p>Michael Garstka, Managing Director of LIST Develop Commercial added: “We are happy to have a modern property here in Hof with experienced partners like Verdion and LIST Bau Nordhorn at our side to realise this project for Dachser.”</p>\n<p>“With the expansion, we are taking the next important step with one of our large DIY customers from the DIY sector in the region,” says Alexander Tonn, Managing Director European Logistics Germany, who is responsible for the German business with industrial goods at Dachser. “Together we are implementing a future-oriented, growth-oriented logistics concept in Hof.”</p>\n<p>Sustainability is a key feature of the project with sustainably-sourced wood playing an important role, in the construction of the building’s roof structure. “Wood has a much better carbon footprint than concrete. Each cubic metre of laminated timber binds about one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> and removes it from the atmosphere. The roof structure will absorb 1,198 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Hof facility. That’s as much as around 108 Germans emit in a year,” explains Andreas Brockhaus, Managing Director of LIST Bau Nordhorn. The wood that is used for the construction comes from sustainably-cultivated German forests.</p>\n<p>Completion is expected in autumn 2020.</p>\n",

The food service logistics firm serves restaurants and convenience stores, with clients including McDonald’s, KFC, Nordsee and Vapiano. It will employ around 200 people at the site.</p>\n<p>“A major focus of the development was the technical expertise needed to meet HAVI’s sustainability requirements,” said Stephan Dalbeck, Business Development Director at Verdion. “In addition to a low-energy and sustainable building design, we implemented the spatial and technical requirements for CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral cooling systems and waste heat recovery, for example, harnessing our longstanding experience in the built-to-suit market.”</p>\n<p>The property received a sustainability certificate in Gold from DGNB, the German Sustainable Building Council.</p>\n<p>Roland Schmidt, Chairman of the Board of HAVI Logistics Germany, added: “This distribution center is not only HAVI’s first location in Lower Saxony but also represents a major milestone in our sustainability strategy.” Verdion and HAVI also installed a liquefied natural gas filling station at the site to serve HAVI’s growing LNG-fueled truck fleet. The company plans to reduce carbon emission per ton delivered by 40 percent until 2030.</p>\n<p>Tritax EuroBox bought this asset in a pre-let forward funded deal for EUR 27.5m at the end of last year. Nick Preston, Fund Manager at Tritax EuroBox said: “A core strand of our investment strategy is to focus on acquiring high-quality, sustainable logistics assets strategically located in established prime logistics locations in Europe. Let to the strong tenant Havi Logistics for the next fifteen years, we believe that this investment will generate an attractive income return for our investors.”</p>\n<p>KLEBL GmbH acted as general contractor, tricer management GmbH as project manager and Büro Kühling as architect in the development. JLL acted as broker for the site and the project.</p>\n",

        "mainContent": "<p>Verdion has agreed a deal with global water technology company Xylem to develop a research and production facility for water analysis equipment at a site in Weilheim, Southern Germany.</p>\n<p>Verdion has acquired a 290,628 sq ft (27,000 sq m) plot in the new Achalaich industrial park in Weilheim in Upper Bavaria from the City of Weilheim. The total investment volume of the project amounts to over 20m euros.</p>\n<p>The property with a total GLA of 141,640 sq ft (15,000 sq m) will consist of four elements: a production plant, in which measuring instruments, sensors and accessories are to be manufactured; a distribution centre; a research laboratory; offices and community space. Xylem has signed a 15-year lease for the facility.</p>\n<p>The company’s analytics business manufactures physicochemical analysis equipment for applications in the fields of water, wastewater, marine and coastal waters, food, beverages, environment, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The company will move from its existing location in Dr.-Karl-Slevogt-Strasse in Weilheim to this modern, bespoke facility.</p>\n<p>Xylem employs around 400 people in Weilheim. The company has been at its current location since 1954 and has an urgent need for more space due to its steady growth. “The new property enables us to significantly modernise and increase efficiency as well as realise growth opportunities,” says Ulrich Schwab, Managing Director of Xylem’s analytics business in Germany.</p>\n<p>“We were very pleased to present Xylem with a compelling, tailor-made concept for this versatile new location,” says André Banschus, Managing Director of Verdion Germany. “Another decisive factor was our expertise in the light industrial sector.”</p>\n<p>Last year, for example, Verdion completed an office and production building for high-performance alloys for Materion Advanced Materials Germany in Alzenau, Northern Bavaria.</p>\n<p>Construction for Xylem is expected to start at the end of this or the beginning of next year. Weilheim is located about 50 km southwest of Munich, near Lake Ammer and Lake Starnberg. The Achalaich industrial estate is connected to the B2, Germany’s longest federal highway, which connects Berlin via Munich with Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Weilheim is also on the Munich-Garmisch-Partenkirchen railway line.</p>\n<p>The project development is financed by the Canadian pension fund Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP), with which Verdion maintains a partnership for the financing, development and management of logistics properties throughout Europe. The property will remain part of the institutional investor’s portfolio after planned completion at the end of 2020 and will be managed by Verdion.</p>\n",

Congratulations to everyone and to the other winners and nominees at Friday’s event.</p>\n<p>Progress in the last twelve months has been significant. Our first rail service started in September, a week after iPort Rail’s formal opening by HRH The Princess Royal. Since then, routes to and from Felixstowe have started and <a href=\"https://www.pdports.co.uk/news-media/2019/06/18/teesport-rail-service-drives-environmental-benefits-ikea/\">PD Ports has confirmed a third service – to and from Teesport</a>. More routes are expected to follow by the end of the year too.</p>\n<p>iPort Rail sits at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.iportuk.com/\">iPort</a>, Verdion’s UK flagship development, which is already home to Amazon, CEVA, Fellowes and Lidl in an established logistics location supported by a strong local workforce. Further build-to-suit opportunities are accompanied by a speculative development programme, with smaller units available in rapid timeframes for those focussed on speed to market.</p>\n<p>Intermodality is a major part of the terminal’s success to date. 87% of the mainland UK population is located within a four-hour drivetime. The East Coast ports are less than one hour away, and the country’s deep-water ports can all be reached in around seven hours. The M18, A1, M1 and <a href=\"http://flydsa.co.uk/\">Doncaster Sheffield Airport</a> are all in easy reach.</p>\n<p>“This is a state-of-the-art facility, capable of handling the UK’s longest trains, and a central part of iPort’s success,” said Michael Hughes, CEO of Verdion.</p>\n<p>“With the logistics sector thriving, rail freight is rightly getting more attention – not least because each freight train journey takes at least 70 HGVs off our road network with many fewer harmful emissions.</p>\n<p>“From this great start, we’re expecting iPort Rail to go from strength to strength as more businesses regionally and nationally see the difference it can make to their supply chains.”</p>\n",

        "mainContent": "<p>The construction of the 15,000 sq m distribution center for HAVI Logistics is progressing rapidly and on schedule. On 11 June 2019, pan-European logistics real estate specialist Verdion, tenant HAVI, investor Tritax EuroBox, broker Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) and construction company Klebl celebrated the topping-out ceremony. The state-of-the-art distribution centre will be handed over by Verdion as planned at the beginning of 2020.</p>\n<p>The roofing of the 64,000 sq m site has now been completed. The office building and the cold-storage area are currently under construction. The floor slab will then be cast in a few weeks‘ time. “We are pleased that the construction work on the logistics property is progressing very quickly. Work on the adjacent roundabout and the new access road will also be completed soon. HAVI will have a new modern distribution centre and our town will continue to develop as a dynamic business location, something we are very pleased about,” commented Mayor Rolf-Axel Eberhardt.</p>\n<p><strong>Close cooperation between all partners</strong></p>\n<p>The rapid progress of construction is made possible above all by “the close, partnership-based exchange with both the Verdion project development team and the tenant HAVI. The cooperation provides for a smooth construction process in which we are meeting all site requirements,” says Andreas Rupp, project manager of the general contractor Klebl GmbH.</p>\n<p>With its plans for the property, Verdion – together with Tritax EuroBox – had won the nationwide investor tender. “Verdion simply delivered the best mix of functionality and economy,” says Michael Starre, Director Business Development Industrial Agency at JLL. The real estate service provider carried out the search for investor and location on behalf of the future tenant.</p>\n<p>Stephan Dalbeck, Business and Portfolio Director of Verdion, emphasised: “The project in Wunstorf is highly exciting due to its complexity and is characterised above all by the excellent teamwork. We continue to look forward to the very good cooperation and the success of the project.”</p>\n<p>Nick Preston, Fund Manager of Tritax EuroBox, added: “Tritax EuroBox only invests in the best prime logistics locations in Europe and with tenants that have strong reputations in the market. So the combination of Wunstorf, with its strategic position on the outskirts of Hanover and at the centre of the main transport routes in northern Germany, and Havi, a leading global provider of supply chain solutions, was too good an opportunity to miss. We look forward to a long and productive working relationship with Havi as they grow their business from this location.  Our recent successful equity raise means Tritax EuroBox will be looking for similar winning investment combinations to Wunstorf, in Germany, and across western European markets, in coming months.”</p>\n<p><strong>LNG filling station for Wunstorf</strong></p>\n<p>The next major milestone of the project will be the set-up of the LNG filling station, the second in the HAVI network after Duisburg. “This is certainly an advantage for the city of Wunstorf, as LNG trucks create significantly less noise and particulate matter than conventional diesel trucks,” explained Torsten Oldhues, Managing Director Operations at HAVI Logistics GmbH.</p>\n",

The food service logistics firm serves restaurants and convenience stores, with clients including McDonald’s, IKEA, Pizza Hut, Subway, Costa Coffee and Vapiano.</p>\n<p>“Being selected by HAVI to deliver its new distribution centre is a testament to our team’s skills, knowledge and track record in developing technology-based logistics facilities,” <strong>said Michael Hughes, CEO of Verdion</strong>. “This is an important milestone in our first collaboration with Tritax EuroBox and we are on track for completion of the development in early 2020.”</p>\n<p><strong>Nick Preston, Fund Manager at Tritax EuroBox said: </strong>“A core strand of EuroBox’s investment strategy is to focus on established prime logistics locations in Europe and partner with the best developers, such as Verdion, to deliver high quality logistics assets leased to market-leading occupiers such as HAVI.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This new, high specification primary distribution facility in Wunstorf meets all of these requirements generating an attractive income return for the next fifteen years and is a valuable addition to our expanding logistics portfolio.”</p>\n<p><strong>Preston added:</strong> “The dynamic growth in European logistics markets in recent years is being driven by strong and growing demand for large, modern well-located logistics assets as occupiers seek to improve their operational efficiency and meet the requirements of a fast-evolving retail market. We believe that there is significant expansion potential in the German market, and across Continental Europe, for this ‘next generation’ type of modern logistics facility.”</p>\n<p>KLEBL GmbH is acting as general contractor, tricer management GmbH as project manager and Büro Kühling as architect in the development.

He explained that warehouses of the future will be technologically advanced and will provide solutions to keep up with increasing consumer demand.</p>\n<p>He said: “UK developers need to learn from their counterparts in Europe, which utilise smart energy saving strategies and time efficient systems to benefit the occupier.</p>\n<p>“Tenants will also play an increasingly prevalent role in the design process, determining exactly what they want from their warehouse.”</p>\n<p>During the ‘Transport infrastructure’ breakout session, Michael Hughes pointed to Verdion’s iPort Rail site in Doncaster as an exciting outcome of the boom in rail freight and a truly multi-modal logistics offering for the UK. He and his fellow panellists recognised the need for Government to invest in better infrastructure to enable more rail freight. They also openly encouraged the creation of more hubs like iPort Rail. The consensus was that there was no reason why different providers couldn’t work together to ensure an increasingly efficient service for customers everywhere.</p>\n<p>The overall take-out from the two-day event was that it’s never been a better time for those in the industrial and logistics sector. We need to keep an eye on Brexit and be ready to adapt, we need to stay abreast of changes in the retail sector and consumer demand, and we need to be agile and responsive to occupier needs.</p>\n",

Construction has started on two units of 120,000 sq ft and 60,000 sq ft, which are scheduled for completion in Q3 2018. These units will complement an existing 195,000 sq ft which is complete and ready for immediate occupation.</p>\n<p>iPort comprises 337 acres of net development land, which links directly to the M18. iPort Rail, the UK’s newest intermodal inland rail freight hub, is also now fully open and operational, welcoming its first train last month.</p>\n<p>Both units will be delivered to a very high specification. Designed and built to a European standard, they will offer 12.5 m internal clear height, comprise steel portal frames and metal sheet roofs, and will be insulated using profile metal sheeting. Single storey, high-quality ancillary office units will also be delivered as part of the overall offering for both units. The 120,000 sq ft unit will offer nine standard dock level doors, 19 HGV parking bays and a 55 m deep yard. The 60,000 sq ft unit will offer three standard dock level doors, 13 HGV parking bays and a 55 m deep yard.</p>\n<p>John Clements, European Development Director at Verdion, said: “These latest developments at iPort will enable us to satisfy a broad range of occupier requirements by delivering a variety of different sized, highly-specified warehouses with exceptional connectivity. Sustained demand for space at iPort has already seen Amazon, CEVA, Fellowes and Lidl take occupancy, and we’re extremely confident these new units will be in equally high demand.”</p>\n<p>Following the completion of this new phase, iPort will cover 2.73 million sq ft of development. A further 3 million sq ft of planned development will be brought forward on the balance of the land. Build to suit opportunities are available from 50,000 sq ft to 1 million sq ft.</p>\n<p>CBRE, Colliers International and Gent Visick are advising Verdion.</p>\n",

Demand for high-quality logistics space in this excellent location remains unbroken.”</p>\n<p>Stuart Reid, Rockspring Partner overseeing Germany, said: “Following the successful letting to DÜRKOP, some 75% of the first two phases have been pre-let. We now look forward to further lettings and developing the rest of Airpark out.”</p>\n<p>Verdion Airpark Berlin is located in close proximity to Berlin’s city centre and is within two kilometres of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport site and adjacent to key road and rail infrastructure. The 92,000 sq m park is being delivered in phases, with both speculative and built-to-suit opportunities for warehousing units ranging from 5,000 sq m to 20,000 sq m. The units have been flexibly designed to the highest specification to meet the strong market demand from 3PLs, retailers and e-tailers seeking urban logistics space.
