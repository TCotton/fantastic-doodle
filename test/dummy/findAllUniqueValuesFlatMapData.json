            "answer": "Verdion Airpark Berlin occupies an exceptional location thirty minutes from Berlin’s central Mitte district, close to Schönefeld Airport and directly opposite the new Berlin Brandenburg International Airport (BER Airport), with excellent transport links. \r\n\r\nIt marks the second of three logistics developments undertaken by Verdion in airport locations, the first being Air Link Park next door, and the third being a logistics facility for UPS next to Prague City Airport. \r\n\r\nVerdion quickly understood this site’s potential and developed a design concept that would maximise its attractiveness for businesses focused on urban logistics. In partnership with Rockspring (which later became PATRIZIA), Verdion acquired the land for Airpark in 2015. Five years later the park was almost fully let, enabling disposal on the open market at record pricing. ",

            "answer": "We chose the site for its strategic location and because we knew the area and its markets well – we had already successfully developed and leased two units for freight company, Dachser, on the Air Link Park next door in 2012. Add to that the boom in e-commerce driving strong growth in the local logistics market, and everything pointed to this being the ideal site for development. From the start we knew that speed and location were key, and we decided to create standardised high-quality buildings that would respond to demand for B2C space and could be developed speculatively. \r\n\r\nDuring the first phase of construction, we leased a facility to Bringmeister, an online food delivery business. The company had specialist requirements for cooling and deep-freezing technology, and for clean areas for food preparation, which we incorporated while still delivering the building on schedule. Dachser leased a further building, expanding from its base at Air Link Park next door, and other companies quickly followed suit, some of them also needing specialist capabilities. ",

            "answer": "Phase 1 completed in 2016, with a total of 29,500 sq m occupied by Bringmeister, Dachser, and metalworking company PUK. Phase 2 followed in 2018, with half of the 22,150 sq m space leased to DÜRKOP GmbH, an auto repair parts supplier, and the other half leased to Streiff & Helmold, a railroad services provider. Phase 3 encompassed a 10,000 sq m logistics facility leased to Dachser SE, as well as four assets each offering 5,000 sq m of space. One was leased to Werner Schulze GmbH, a wholesaler for printable merchandising, another to HOCO Online GmbH, a bicycle and spare parts shipping company. ",

            "answer": "All three phases at Airpark – a site that was empty and inactive for several years before we acquired it – were leased before construction was complete, demonstrating our ability to anticipate market requirements and bring forward high-quality warehousing at precisely the right time. \r\n\r\nThe most important timing, though, was that of our partner’s exit. Airpark’s success had been a catalyst for the wider area, including the development of hotels and office buildings. With the park complete and the local logistics market booming, it was time for PATRIZIA to reap the benefits and return significant value back into its fund in one of the most notable logistics deals of the year. \r\n\r\nMichael Hughes, CEO of Verdion, said: \r\n\r\n“Against a backdrop of significant e-commerce sector growth, the fundamentals that originally made this site an attractive development opportunity still hold true. At the same time, Airpark offers very high-quality buildings designed to meet occupier requirements for years to come. The park’s potential is reflected in the pricing achieved, with the outcome for our partners, PATRIZIA, setting a record price in this market.”",

A key feature of our design is the physical separation of the office accommodation, with its looser requirements, from the production and R&D areas. People are less likely to move between the two, and when they do the demarcation will be clear. Office staff won’t need to concern themselves with clothing changes or cross sensitive areas to reach communal space.

Funded by Verdion, the academy works with local job-seekers to offer training and puts them in touch with businesses at iPort that have vacancies to fill. On completion of the park, the workforce here is expected to be around 5,000 people. \r\n\r\nTo offset the environmental impact of constructing on this greenfield site, Verdion allocated approximately 50% of the total land area (162 ha) as open green space, including forests, meadows and a large area dedicated to wetlands and wildlife, created with the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust and open for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\niPort also benefits from a Green Travel Plan that Verdion administers, encouraging people coming to the site to use alternative forms of transport to cars, such as cycling, walking, public transport, and ridesharing. As well as bringing forward the new road, Verdion voluntarily constructed dedicated cycleways and walking routes to connect iPort to residential areas of Doncaster and help increase these sustainable transport options.\r\n\r\nCllr Bill Mordue, Cabinet Member for Business, Skills and Economic Development at Doncaster Council, said: \r\n\r\n“The growth at iPort has been astonishing. The site has already welcomed globally recognised tenants and the opening of its rail freight facility is another big step forward for Verdion’s ambitious plans. It was our forward-thinking vision to create Great Yorkshire Way which has seen iPort develop at such a rapid rate, boosting our growing economy. iPort is a huge success story for Doncaster and the wider region.” ",

The accommodation will be available as one unit or subdivided into four smaller units of 9,200 sq m to 10,500 sq m, together with ancillary offices and mezzanine space, 40 docking positions and parking for 155 cars and 13 HGVs. \r\n\r\nRare for most speculatively developed buildings of this kind, the detail of the specification incorporated into the plans broadens its appeal to potential occupiers who need space quickly. In addition to 11m clear height and 50kN/m² floor loading, a lowered floor slab and insertion of foils for the retention of substances hazardous to water (WGK I-III) mean the building is equipped for the safe production and storage of hazardous and pharmaceutical goods.\r\n\r\nVerdion’s asset management team will manage both facilities over the long term, handling all commercial and insurance requirements. They will work closely with the facilities managers to make sure occupiers’ needs are met and the building continues to function efficiently and sustainably.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndré Banschus, Executive Director at Verdion, said: \r\n\r\n“Our decision to speculatively develop reflects our strong confidence in the investment fundamentals of logistics real estate in Germany. There is high demand for space and this Hanover location is ideal for e-commerce, with tram connections for the local workforce and fast access to the motorway network for the efficient movement of goods.”",

The company had to be sure we could meet the technical, security and IT requirements for storing and distributing such a high-value and sensitive product, but was quickly satisfied by the experience and track record of the team we put in place and, in particular, our CTO and Technical Director. \r\nAs for so many of our projects, we achieved the best design for this facility by taking an international approach. A radical redesign based on experience across Europe achieved both an optimal build-up ratio in line with Danish market expectations and a much more flexible future option for expansion, while staying in line with the original zoning plan.",

For this reason we needed to put the \r\nthe requirements of the IT systems at the heart of our work. These systems help track each tiny package’s movement through the warehouse, along with every change in temperature or humidity – all connecting to the client’s headquarters for regular monitoring and alerts. \r\n\r\nWe created backups of everything (though the quality of the original was so good most weren’t needed). If a cooling unit fails, another takes over, while a back-up diesel generator \r\nCovers the main operation and climate control.\r\n\r\nOutside the building this commitment to control and efficiency continues. Inflatable dock shelters provide sealing around delivery vehicles to maintain temperature, humidity and airtightness when the trailer is in the dock position, while secure handling facilities for air freight were also installed for a smoother onward journey.

            "answer": "Verdion’s first project in Sweden, in Staffanstorp just outside Malmö, was a natural progression from our development activity across the bridge in Copenhagen. Working with local partners and the municipality, we identified the site for our 8-ha Verdion Logistics Park Malmö. Then, following an introduction from Invest in Skåne, we won BMW’s contract to provide a new 27,000 sq m warehouse for storing and distributing car and motorcycle parts throughout the Nordics, and to parts of the Baltics region.

            "answer": "BMW’s IT systems support a process that is unlike other automotive firms, in that each order is received through the company’s HQ in Germany, and then every single component part destined for the Nordics and parts of the Baltics is distributed via this new facility. \r\n\r\nThe business had been told that its IT systems, as well as its heating and electrics – the same systems BMW uses in its German facilities – would be too difficult to install in a Swedish facility. Our team didn’t agree. We understood why this was so important and had already successfully undertaken similar projects for other clients in Germany. \r\n\r\nTogether with the Danish contractor we’d worked with previously to deliver a highly complex pharmaceutical distribution warehouse for DHL [add link to DHL, Greve], we created a robust design and methodology for the project that would meet BMW’s needs.  \r\n\r\nOur design not only accommodated the high-specification IT needed to support the demands of this ordering system but also incorporated a complex storage solution across a three-level mezzanine, for parts that range from the smallest washer up to twelve-cylinder engines weighing around 270 kilos. \r\n\r\nWe handed the completed facility over in May 2017 – one month earlier than the deadline – giving BMW more time to spend on its interior fitout. And should they need more space, we have already secured room for expansion on the same plot. ",
